# Time Reality Comparison: Bitter vs. SCSN  
### (Teams of 2–4 People, 3–10 Years of Experience, Mixed Education Levels)

---

## Overview

This comparison examines realistic project durations for two educational prototypes:  
**Bitter** – a web-first social network; and  
**SCSN** – Senior Citizens Social Network, focused on civic and safety-support communication.

Assumptions:

- Team size: **2–4 people**
- Experience range: **3–10 years** per member
- Education: mixed **bachelor’s and master’s degrees** in Computer Science, IT, or design-related fields
- Work environment: **high fragmentation** (interruptions, meetings, context-switching)
- Factors like **technical documentation**, **testing**, **legal/compliance**, and **ethical review** are fully accounted for.

Studies consistently show that context switching and organizational overhead can reduce effective productivity by **20–40%**.

## 1. Bitter – Web-First Social Network (Educational Prototype)

### Scope

HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end; PHP + SQLite/MariaDB backend; posting and feed system; simulated login;  
plus documentation, accessibility testing, and deployment notes.

| Team Profile | Experience / Education | Estimated Calendar Time (High Fragmentation) | Major Time Consumers |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Team A** | 3–5 years, early-career BS/BA | **8–12 weeks (≈2–3 months)** | Core coding, UX iteration, documentation, debugging, testing, and weekly review cycles. |
| **Team B** | 5–8 years, mixed BS/MS | **8–12 weeks (≈2–3 months)** | More structured QA, documentation standards, improved maintainability focus. |
| **Team C** | 8–10 years, senior/staff engineers | **8–12 weeks (≈2–3 months)** | Additional review cycles, compliance reviews, architectural validation, and handover docs. |

> Even with greater experience, real-world production and legal requirements keep timelines steady rather than shorter.

## 2. SCSN – Senior Citizens Social Network (Civic & Safety Support)

### Scope

Includes all Bitter features, plus:
- **Flip-phone keypad** for simplified user input.
- **Safety-oriented “kinds” of posts** (`normal`, `help`, `911`, `emergency_address`).
- **Accessibility & readability reviews** for older adult users.
- **Documentation** of civic, ethical, and safety boundaries.
- **Legal disclaimers** to prevent misuse as an emergency system.

| Team Profile | Experience / Education | Estimated Calendar Time (High Fragmentation) | Major Time Consumers |
|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Team A** | 3–5 years, early-career BS/BA | **12–20 weeks (≈3–5 months)** | UI/UX testing, accessibility reviews, documentation, extended QA, and review loops. |
| **Team B** | 5–8 years, mix of BS/MS | **12–20 weeks (≈3–5 months)** | Policy and documentation design, privacy and data compliance, improved maintainability. |
| **Team C** | 8–10 years, senior/staff or design focus | **12–20 weeks (≈3–5 months)** | Legal review simulation, ethical audit documentation, and final presentation/report drafting. |

## 3. Why Experience Does Not Greatly Shorten the Timeline

### 3.1 Documentation & Knowledge Management

- Industry standards show **10–20%** of total effort goes into writing and maintaining documentation (Sigasi, 2013).  
- Developers spend only **16% of their time actively coding**, with the rest in documentation, communication, and searching for info (Atlassian, 2025).

### 3.2 Testing & Quality Assurance

- Testing and QA typically take **25% of total project effort**, while **project management adds another 10–15%** (Stack Overflow, 2013).  
- Civic prototypes like SCSN need extra care in validating edge cases and avoiding “false sense of safety” issues.

### 3.3 Legal, Compliance, and Ethical Review

- Compliance adds layers of review for privacy, storage, and data retention (Essential Designs, 2025).  
- Nulab (2024) notes compliance and policy alignment are “multi-faceted,” requiring time even for prototypes.

### 3.4 Fragmentation and Organizational Inefficiency

- Context switching causes **20–40% loss in productive focus time** (Scrum.org, 2023; Conclude.io, 2025).  
- Developers lose **6–10+ hours per week** to communication friction and lack of clarity (Atlassian, 2025).

## 4. Summary of Realistic Duration

| Project | Estimated Range | Primary Drivers |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Bitter** | 8–12 weeks (2–3 months) | Documentation, QA, team fragmentation, versioning, and civic reporting. |
| **SCSN** | 12–20 weeks (3–5 months) | Legal review, accessibility, safety documentation, and multi-round testing. |

Even highly experienced teams focus their additional time on **stability, compliance, and maintainability**, not speed.  
In real conditions, civic or educational tech projects must allow for **documentation, ethical design, and long-tail review**, which dominate project time more than coding itself.
