**Bitter** is a lightweight, front-end-only social application mockup created for **educational purposes**.  
It demonstrates layout, component structure, and basic event handling in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, following accessibility and semantic web standards.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was designed as a **non-commercial classroom example** showing:
- Basic **HTML5 structure** (`header`, `aside`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
- Responsive layout using **CSS Flexbox**.
- Simple UI interaction via **JavaScript event handling**.
- Client-side, no-backend simulation of user login, posting, and interface rendering.

---

## 🧱 Application Layout

The interface is divided into three main sections:

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Header** | Displays the application name (`Bitter`) and tagline. |
| **Sidebar (Left)** | Contains user info, list of other users, and a simple menu (Login, Logout, Settings). |
| **Main Feed (Center)** | Shows highlighted content, a post composer, and a scrollable content feed with “speech bubble” style posts. |
| **Scroll Bar Indicator (Right)** | A stylized vertical bar mimicking a scroll hint, matching the educational wireframe. |
| **Footer** | Lists APA-style references used for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript educational grounding. |

---

## 💡 Features

- **No external dependencies** – fully standalone HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Front-end login simulation** (no server required).
- **Local post handling** – new posts appear in the in-memory feed.
- **Accessible labels** (`aria-label` attributes) for educational focus.
- **Responsive layout** – works on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **APA-formatted references** for academic transparency.
